#  Voxel rendering project

This was an experiment in rendering and world generation. I wanted to learn C++ but also improve on the rendering I wrote in earlier projects and also toy with random world generation. This is more of an experiment than a game (I never learned C++ enough to take this project past this level) but it makes some nice looking scenes and I'm pretty happy with how the world generation turned out. I made this in about two weeks, with the great help of older code I wrote and re-used.
